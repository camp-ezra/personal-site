      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I have a BA in English literature from Tulane University, and I have done transcription work and video captioning since graduating in 2015.
          I feel ready to move on to something that exercises more of my analyzing abilities, and something that I find more
          creative. I utilize research and problem-solving skills in my transcription, and I always persevere when faced with a problem, so I am confident that my skills
          will transfer well to web development. I am also eager to do work that is more collaborative, as opposed to the solitary nature of most
          transcription work.
